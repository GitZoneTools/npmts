# Get Started with NPMTS
and learn how to quickly write npm TypeScript modules

## Step1: Install the tools

To use npmts install it using npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install -g npmts # install with npm
yarn global add npmts # install with yarn
```

For the puspose of getting started quickly also install **gitzone**.
It'll proovide awesome scaffolding for new npmts npm modules and also updates them later on. 

```shell
npm install -g gitzone # install with npm
yarn global add gitzone # install with yarn
```

You can make sure npmts and gitzone are installed correctly by typing `npmts -v && gitzone -v`.

## Scaffold a new module

To scaffold a new module type

```shell
gitzone template npm
```

This will run you through a series of question to get gitzone to know the specifics of your module.
Enter all information accordingly.

## Run NPMTS for the first time
